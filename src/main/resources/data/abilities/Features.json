While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:\n- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\n- When you make a melee weapon Attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.\n- You have Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\nIf you are able to cast Spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked Unconscious or if Your Turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on Your Turn as a Bonus Action.\nOnce you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a Long Rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th."

When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity."
